# Day 14: Random Cat Gallery

### Goal
To reinforce knowledge of data structures and problem solving skills by creating a gif generator.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise the student will be able to:
- Create a wireframe sketch.
- Build HTML in match a wireframe sketch.
- Examine a gifs variable in script.js and data.js to determine data structures in use.
- Design a web application that displays random gifs.

### Instructions

- Take a moment to sketch out what you want your cat gif generator to look like. It should have a box to place the random gif, as well as a button to shuffle through the data.
- Build out the HTML for what you sketched, give it some funky styles too!
- Examine the gifs variable in script.js as well as the data in data.js. What data structures are being used? _Try to access the data there in Chromes’s console to see the contents of the gifs object._
- Your cat gif generator should select a random gif from gifs and display it. It’s okay for this to happen when the page loads at first.
- Next, add an event listener to your button that selects a random gif from gifs and displays it.



### Bonus:
> Got through that pretty quickly? Think about this; randomly selecting a gif 25 times would likely have at least 1 gif left out and another appearing twice in the series.
>How would you go about making sure you get a different gif 25 times, but every time you go through the 25 gifs they’re in a completely different order. Hint: **Shuffle**?

### Completion Requirements

- Complete Workshop by end of allotted time limit.
- The completed assignment:
  - displays a random gif when loaded.
  - has a button for displaying another gif.
  - is accompanied with an appropriate wireframe.
- Group review session with the instructor.
